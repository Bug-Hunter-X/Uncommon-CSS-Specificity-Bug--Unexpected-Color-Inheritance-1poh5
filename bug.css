The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override the parent's color */
}
```

In this example, the `div p` selector is supposed to override the `color: blue` set for the `div` element.  However, if a `p` element within the `div` inherits some other styles from a global style sheet or from a more specific selector, there might be unexpected behavior. For example:

```css
/*Somewhere else in the stylesheet or an external stylesheet */
p { color: purple; }
```

In such scenarios, the `color: green` in `div p` might be overridden by the higher-specificity `p { color: purple }` even if `div p` comes later in the CSS file. This can lead to unexpected and subtle errors.
